Gunmetal
========

Gunmetal is a light and fast dependency injection and application-modularisation tool for Java.

Gunmetal has zero required dependencies, yet it offers full JSR-330 support.

Gunmetal start-up is roughly 14 times faster than Guice and 1/3 as fast as the source-code-generating Dagger.

Gunmetal offers powerful extensibility through component post-processors, aspects, and custom component scopes.

Gunmetal also brings a couple of new features - dynamic composites and deconstructed APIs.

The initial release of Gunmetal to the Maven Central Repo is anticipated for the 3rd quarter of 2013.  

Where's the user guide and javadoc??  It's coming, just give us a little time.
