Gunmetal
========

Gunmetal is a light and fast dependency-injection and application-modularisation tool for Java.

Nice things about Gunmetal:

    - zero required dependencies
    - full JSR-330 support
    - generics injection
    - incredibly fast build-deploy cycles
    - unmatched wiring. if you can wire it by hand, gunmetal can wire it
    - powerful extensibility through component post-processors, aspects, and custom component scopes
    - a couple of new DI features (dynamic composites and deconstructed APIs are nice)

The initial release of Gunmetal to the Maven Central Repo is some time in 2014.  

Where's the user guide and javadoc??  It's coming, just give us a little time.  The API isn't yet in stone.

Currently the API is being finalized after spending most of the time so far on internal performance and 
capabilities. There isn't much explanation of anything, but some of the ideas being actively developed can 
be found here for the interested:  http://github.com/overengineer/gunmetal/wiki/API-Design-Scratch-Pad
