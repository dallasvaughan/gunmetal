Gunmetal
========

Gunmetal is a light and fast dependency-injection and application-modularisation tool for Java.

Nice things about Gunmetal:

    - enhancements to Java visibility and access modifiers to complement layered architectures
    - zero required dependencies
    - full JSR-330 support
    - generics injection, collection injection
    - fast build-deploy cycles
    - unmatched wiring. if you can wire it by hand, gunmetal can wire it
    - extensibility through component post-processors, aspects, and custom component scopes
    - configurable enforcement and override options for programming to interfaces, disallowing circular graphs, etc

The initial release of Gunmetal to the Maven Central Repo is slated for some time in 2014. 

Current work can be found at https://github.com/overengineer/gunmetal/tree/api-refactor

The user guide and javadoc are on hold until the API is more stable.

Currently the API is being finalized after spending most of the time so far on internal performance and 
capabilities. There isn't much explanation of anything, but some of the ideas being actively developed can 
be found here for the interested:  http://github.com/overengineer/gunmetal/wiki/API-Design-Scratch-Pad
