Gunmetal
========

Gunmetal is a light and fast dependency injection and application-modularisation tool for Java.

Nice things about Gunmetal:

    - zero required dependencies
    - full JSR-330 support
    - start-up is roughly 14 times faster than Guice and 1/3 as fast as the source-code-generating Dagger
    - powerful extensibility through component post-processors, aspects, and custom component scopes
    - a couple of new DI features (dynamic composites and deconstructed APIs kick ass)

The initial release of Gunmetal to the Maven Central Repo is anticipated for the 3rd quarter of 2013.  

Where's the user guide and javadoc??  It's coming, just give us a little time.
